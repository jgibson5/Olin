Actually Gollum lived on a slimy island of rock in the middle of thelake. He was watching Bilbo now from the distance with his pale eyes liketelescopes. Bilbo could not see him, but he was wondering a lot aboutBilbo, for he could see that he was no goblin at all.

Gollum got into his boat and shot off from the island, while Bilbo wassitting on the brink altogether flummoxed and at the end of his way and hiswits. Suddenly up came Gollum and whispered and hissed:

"Bless us and splash us, my precioussss! I guess it's a choice feast; atleast a tasty morsel it'd make us, gollum!" And when he said gollum he madea horrible swallowing noise in his throat. That is how he got his name,though he always called himself 'my precious.'

The hobbit jumped nearly out of his skin when the hiss came in his ears,and he suddenly saw the pale eyes sticking out at him.

"Who are you?" he said, thrusting his dagger in front of him.

"What iss he, my preciouss?" whispered Gollum (who always spoke tohimself through never having anyone else to speak to). This is what he hadcome to find out, for he was not really very hungry at the moment, onlycurious; otherwise he would have grabbed first and whispered afterwards.

"I am Mr. Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I have lost thewizard, and I don't know where I am; and I don't want to know, if only Ican get away."

"What's he got in his handses?" said Gollum, looking at the sword, whichhe did not quite like.

"A sword, a blade which came out of Gondolin!"
